# Therapybookingportal
The Project Is a Therapy Booking Portal Using React created in CodeSandBox.io and used dependencies like react-Dom, react-router-Dom, and react-scripts. Users Can log in to the Website and book therapy appointments for various services and therapies available.
â€¢ The therapy booking portal allows users to sign in or register easily and book appointments for therapy sessions. Leveraging HTML and CSS, I crafted an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.
