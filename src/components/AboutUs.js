      <h1>Our Therapy</h1>
      <p>
        A therapy or medical treatment (often abbreviated tx, Tx, or Tx) is the
        attempted remediation of a health problem, usually following a medical
        diagnosis. As a rule, each therapy has indications and
        contraindications. There are many different types of therapy. Not all
        therapies are effective. Many therapies can produce unwanted adverse
        effects. Medical treatment and therapy are generally considered
        synonyms. However, in the context of mental health, the term therapy may
        refer specifically to psychotherapy.

      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Before the creating of therapy as a formal procedure, people told
        stories to one another to inform and assist about the world.[1] The term
        "healing through words" was used over 3,500 years ago in Greek and
        Egyptian writing.[2] The term psychotherapy was invented in the 19th
        century,[3] and psychoanalysis was founded by Sigmund Freud under a
        decade later. Therapy, also called psychotherapy or counseling, is the
        process of meeting with a therapist to resolve problematic behaviors,
        beliefs, feelings, relationship issues, and/or somatic responses
        (sensations in the body).

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        It helps build self-esteem, reduce anxiety, strengthen coping
        mechanisms, and improve social and community functioning. Supportive
        psychotherapy helps patients deal with issues related to their mental
        health conditions which in turn affect the rest of their lives.
        Psychotherapy can be provided by a number of different types of
        professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed social
        workers, licensed professional counselors, licensed marriage and family
        therapists, psychiatric nurses, and others with specialized training in
        psychotherapy. Psychiatrists are also trained in medicine and are able
        to prescribe medications.
